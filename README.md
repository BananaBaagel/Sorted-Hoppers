It sorts hoppers

## How to use
Once you have the mod installed, go into any world (existing or new) and you will be able to craft sorted hoppers (to be made)

## Can I use it in a modpack?
Yes, please use it however you want!


# Plans for the future
* Make content for this mod
  * make a craftable hopper that uses sorting
    * probably craft with 4 iron, 1 redstone (maybe torch), 1 quartz, and 1 chest
  * make a wand to show you all sorted hoppers
  * make client-side implementation to show all sorted hoppers

*To those who understand, I lost the game. To those who don't, if you think about the game, you lose. You appear to be reading this, so you just lost the game.*
